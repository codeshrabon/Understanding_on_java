OOP is a programming lang... where i can organze my code using objects and
classes.. It help makes my code resuable, mouler and easy to maintain..


1. Encapsulation -> hiding internal data using private variables and access them through public method
2. abstraction -> hiding code just show only thing that important
3. inheritance -> use code from one class to another
4. polymorphism -> same method workd different in different classes
