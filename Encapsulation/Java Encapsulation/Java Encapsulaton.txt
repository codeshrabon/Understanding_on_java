1. hide the data from the user
1.1 declear the class variable/attributes as private 
1.2 provice public get and set method to access or update the value of orivate varibale/attribute

2. why we use encapsulation
2.1 better control of class attribute and methods
2.2 Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
2.3 Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
2.4 Increased security of data
